# OpynTogether
Pseudo smart contract in Solidity 0.7.x for Opyn v1 use.

An idea to solve the issue of small players not being able to earn liquidity providing fees + prevent uncomfortable UX for long call/put holders to retain liquidity.

# Notice
The pseudo smart contract is not guaranteed to work as intended. It is merely a proof of concept. I cannot guarantee the contract does not have any bugs present. 

If you plan to fork, do **NOT** deploy the contract as written in the original UNLESS you're absolutely sure it is safe.
